# Spjalla

Spjalla is an IRC client written in C++ that runs in a terminal. Its goals are configurability, extensibility and usability.
It's currently in development, so not everything is working yet and it's not recommended for general use. If you'd like to help out, you can submit a pull request, but be warned that the code is pretty messy right now.
